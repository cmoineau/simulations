# SandPile 

- P5 js

## Rules

For this simulation, we begin with a grid. Each box as a value attach to it.

The greater the value the darker the box.

At each itteration we increase the value of a random box by one.

If the box as a value of 4, we set its value to 0 and increase the value of its adjacent neighbours by one.
